Updates to load network automatically at boot. Built into the kernel the wifi driver attempts to load firmware before RFS is mounted. Loading as a module will prevent that.

linux-custom:
	arch/arm/configs/mx7_96_defconfig -  updated to move wifi driver to module.

support-files:
	linux.config - uppdated to move wifi driver to module
	overlay/etc/init.d/S35modules - added to force load of fmac module on boot
